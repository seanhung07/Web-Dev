This is another unique recipe of American pizza which mane is influenced by the Mexican Waves. Mexican Green Wave Pizza is loaded with crunchy onions, crispy capsicum, juicy tomato, and jalapeno. This is a spicy flavor which is topped by my liberal sprinkling of the exotic Mexican herbs. This is a very popular pizza among the veggies and is a common flavor among those who love spice pizzas.
